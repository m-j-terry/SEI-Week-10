        <li>Explain what a REST API is. What makes an API "RESTful"?</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>REST APIs allow for the separation of client and server concerns, allowing the application to handle client and server needs accordingly. Express allows the Node.js to act as the middle man, handling client responses and fetching the appropriate data either from a database or html from other files. To be "RESTful" refers to the application's routes for handling client and server concerns. There are seven 'RESTing' routes, conveniently remembered as the acronym INDUCES--Index, New, Delete, Update, Create, Edit, Show.</li> </ol>
        
        
        <li>What is Node.js and why is it often used when building server-side applications?</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>Node.js allows back-end applications to use javascript functionality without HTML and DOM manipulation, instead, it accepts client requests and, with the help of express, responds with either an HTML template from jsx or data from a database like mongoDB. Because it is JS, it allows the back end code and front end DOM manipulation to work together seemlessly.</li> </ol>
        
        
        <li>Express.js is a popular framework used in conjunction with Node.js. What are some of the key features of Express.js that make it useful for building web servers?</li> 
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>In terms of the MVC (model-view-controller) organizing principle for back-end functionality, express is the 'controller', meaning that it will handle client requests and server payloads, and application responses. Because express.js is capable of handling not only the client requests but is able to access (and update!) the server, to fetch and serve new HTML, and to send responses back to the client, it is an extremely flexible and versatile tool for developing dynamic, RESTful APIs. </li> </ol>


        <li>In Express.js, what is middleware and how is it used?</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>Middleware is any software that can be installed and added to an application's package.json to enhance functionality and give the application additional 'superpowers'. In terms of middleware, we have used mongoose, nodemon, jsx-view-engine, and method-override in our applications. Method-override, for example, allows the application to override POST requests and perform DELETE and UPDATE requests, which are not possible without the middleware.</li> </ol>


        <li>In terms of HTTP verbs, what is the difference between GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE? When would you use each in the context of a RESTful API?</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>GET asks the database for some data and returns it for the client to view and then possibly perform one of the other verbs on. POST allows the client to input new data into an application. PUT and PATCH alike allow the client to edit or alter the existing data in the database; the difference is that PATCH allows the client to edit more selectively rather than updating the entire source. DELETE allows the client to remove information from a database, permanently altering it. The ability to perform these basic routes is the foundation of every successful application.</li> </ol>


        <li>How would you handle parameters in the URL with Express.js? Provide an example.</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>Parameters determine the functional route that express will take. by adding a '/name' to the end of the url, engineers can effectively tell the page exactly when to fulfill which requests. For example, our SHOW request in the fruits file waits for the url to end in '/fruits/:id': when the client clicks on the name of one of the created fruit objects, the fruits id is automatically inputted into the url following '/fruits'. </li> </ol>


        <li>How can you handle error situations when building an Express.js API?</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>You use the try-catch block. Try is the response the client will receive if the function ran without error; catch is what will catch the app from crashing if, for instance, one of the reqs was invalidly inputted.</li> </ol>


        <li>When building a RESTful API with Express.js, how would you structure your routes for a resource like items? What would the endpoints look like for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations?</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>Using the CRUD method to frame the routes on the resources items, the routes ought to all begin with the /items directory. From there, additional html can be updated/added through the viewport. </li> </ol>


        <li>How would you parse incoming request bodies in Express.js? Provide an example of how you might handle a JSON payload.</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>The RESTful routes--namely, in this instance, POST, PUT, PATCH, and EDIT--handle how incoming requests will be handled by express js. For instance, in our fruits application, when the user sent a POST request after filling in the information for new fruit: the information is recorded in the JSON payload, which is a plain english, listed description of the data that looks a bit like a JS object which the user is sending to the server. The NEW.jsx file essentially limited the kind of input that the server would receive so that all of the fruit objects would be identically formatted, making parsing through the payload maneagable for the express application.</li> </ol>


        <li>How can testing be implemented for a RESTful API built with Node and Express? Provide an example of a test case for one of your API endpoints.</li>  
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; list-style-type: none; text-indent: 1em; margin-left: -2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li class = answer>There are three types of testing: Unit testing(tests isolated pieces of code), Integration testing (tests isolated pieces of code at work together), system testing (tests all of the code). Of course, using unit testing can help identify if there was problem with a certain route, such as a route to create a new object according to the preexisting schema. If the route itself can run without errors from the unit test, it can be performed again in an integration test, testing not only the routes but the view engine as well, for example. Lastly, system wide testing can test the integration of all of the system's parts together.</li> </ol>
